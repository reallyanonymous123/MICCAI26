# Installation

Python>=3.8.0 environment, including PyTorch>=1.8.
The command is as follows.

```bash
conda create -n aaai python=3.8
conda activate miccai
pip install -r requirements.txt  # install
```

Please locate the package directory of your Anaconda virtual environment, and replace the following file:

`your_envs\Lib\site-packages\torch\nn\modules\dropout.py`

with the modified version of `dropout.py` provided in this repository.

The `dropout.py` file can be found in the **root directory** of this repository.

# Datasets

Please prepare the data in the YOLO dataset format. We will provide the preprocessed data, including images and labels, which can be directly used for training. Additionally, we will also provide the trained weights, which can be directly used for testing.

# Training
Most of training configurations can change in the "Train settings" section of ultralytics/cfg/default.yaml. 
The key factors are model, data, img, epoches, batch, device and training hyperparameters.
For example, you can use "model：YOLO-improved.yaml" to train an object detection model.

```bash
python train.py 
```

# Evaluation
Most of evaluation configurations can change in the "Val/Test settings" section of ultralytics/cfg/default.yaml. 
The key factors are model(weight), data, img, batch, conf, iou, half.

```bash
python ultralytics/models/yolo/detect/val.py
```
